Welcome to Python LiveReload
=============================

`LiveReload  <http://livereload.com/>`_ contains two parts,
the client side and the server side.
And Python LiveReload is the server side in python version.

Web Developers need to refresh a browser everytime when he saves a file (css,
javascript, html). It is really boring. LiveReload will take care of that for
you. When you save a file, your browser will refresh itself.

And what's more, it can do some tasks like 
**compiling less to css before the browser refreshing**.
